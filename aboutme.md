I am an engineer, researcher, and aspiring developer with a passion for learning and a fascination with free and open source software. I have a Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech and currently work as a researcher at the [Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)](https://www.epri.com/) in the [Energy Storage and Distributed Generation program](https://www.epri.com/research/programs/053125).

In my free time you can catch me outside hiking, biking or climbing, or inside coding up solutions to all of life's minor inconveniences.
