##### I love making useful things. 
This site exists to share some of my favorite personal projects that (I hope) are good enough to expose to the public. Feel free to reach out with any questions or comments and stay tuned for more posts! 

## <a href="posts">Personal Projects</a>
### <a href="2025-01-27-MiniSplit-Controller">Mini-Split WiFi Controller Retrofit</a>
**Making a Dumb Ductless Mini Split Wall Unit Smart.** This project uses inexpensive, off-the-shelf electronics and open source software (ESPHome) to connect a Mitsubishi ductless minisplit heat pump to Home Assistant for much improved, fully local control.

### <a href="2022-03-26-Baby-SpiCroft">Baby SpiCroft - A Raspberry Pi Baby Monitor and Smart Speaker Built on Open Source</a>
A low-latency, WebRTC baby monitor and open source smart speaker ([Picroft](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-mycroft-ai/get-mycroft/picroft)) built on a Raspberry Pi. The baby monitor allows any browser on the local wifi network to connect to a high quality, real time media stream from the Pi's infrared camera and USB connected condenser microphone. 

This project was motivated by the birth of our first child and was a blast to put together! Check out [this blog post for more information](2022-03-26-Baby-SpiCroft) or you can jump to the [install instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/jhthompson12/BabySpiCroft-Setup-Files).

### <a href="https://github.com/jhthompson12/Baby_Tracker_App">The Locally Hosted Baby Tracker Web App</a>
A Python-based web app built with [Plotly Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) that helps weary and paranoid parents easily track critical baby functions throughout the day. Things like sleep times, feeding details, and potty events can be input and viewed via a web browser. Check out the code and install instructions in [this Github repo](https://github.com/jhthompson12/Baby_Tracker_App). 

I know there's probably tons of apps that will track these things for you, but this is customizable and keeps you in control of your baby's sensitive poo data. I have this running on the [Baby SpiCroft](2022-03-26-Baby-SpiCroft) device mentioned above and it has been surprisingly helpful with keeping track of baby's development.
